Responses: from Archetypes to Zope 3 (original)
===============================================

For an alternative migrator see the tests in
migration_old_responses_alternative.txt.

To test migration we have added some sample content::

    >>> catalog = self.portal.portal_catalog
    >>> len(catalog(portal_type='PoiTracker'))
    2
    >>> len(catalog(portal_type='PoiIssue'))
    6
    >>> len(catalog(portal_type='PoiResponse'))
    24

We look at the first issue created.  Like all the others it has five
oldstyle response and no new style responses::

    >>> tracker = self.portal.foo
    >>> issue = tracker.foo
    >>> len(issue.objectValues(spec='PoiResponse'))
    4
    >>> from Products.Poi.adapters import IResponseContainer
    >>> rc = IResponseContainer(issue)
    >>> len(rc)
    0

We have a checker to see if an upgrade step is necessary:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import has_old_responses
    >>> has_old_responses(self.portal)
    True

We call the migrator on this issue::

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import replace_old_with_new_responses
    >>> replace_old_with_new_responses(issue)

Now the numbers of old and new style responses have flipped::

    >>> len(issue.objectValues(spec='PoiResponse'))
    0
    >>> len(rc)
    4

Calling the migrator a second time has no ill effect::

    >>> replace_old_with_new_responses(issue)
    >>> len(issue.objectValues(spec='PoiResponse'))
    0
    >>> len(rc)
    4

Calling the migrator on something that is not a PoiIssue (actually not
implementing IIssue), gives no errors::

    >>> replace_old_with_new_responses(self.portal)

Calling migrate_responses searches for all PoiTrackers and migrates
all responses::

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import migrate_responses
    >>> migrate_responses(self.portal)


All PoiResponses are gone after migration and they have been added as
new style responses::

    >>> len(catalog(portal_type='PoiResponse'))
    0
    >>> issues = catalog(portal_type='PoiIssue')
    >>> len(issues)
    6
    >>> for issue in issues:
    ...     issue = issue.getObject()
    ...     rc = IResponseContainer(issue)
    ...     self.assertEqual(len(rc), 4)

Our checker also agrees that there are no old responses anymore:

    >>> has_old_responses(self.portal)
    False
