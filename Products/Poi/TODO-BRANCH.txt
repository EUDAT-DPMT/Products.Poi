To do in this branch before merging back to trunk
=================================================

- Add migration (GS upgrade step?) from PoiResponses to new style
  responses.

- Send email when response is added.

- Update SearchableText of issue when response in
  added/changed/removed.

- Remove button for adding old style response to issue.

- Add i18n (to avoid problems in merging it is probably best not to
  actually run ./i18n/rebuildAll.sh).

- Make sure the tests keep running when content/PoiResponse.py is
  removed.  This file should not *really* be removed though as we need
  it still during migration.

- Remove skins/Poi/determineResponseType.py

- See if the isValid and post_validate methods from PoiResponse need
  to be kept in some form.  All others have been sufficiently dealt
  with (except sendResponseNotificationMail but that is a different
  point above).

- Add handling for the target releases field (available only when
  using the PSC tracker).

- Show attachment upload widget.

- Only show options like changing state when the user has permission
  to use them.

- Use memoize or similar to get html responses.  Makes views faster.
  It works for old style responses.
