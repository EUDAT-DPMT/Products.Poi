To do in this branch before merging back to trunk
=================================================

- Add i18n (to avoid problems in merging it is probably best not to
  actually run ./i18n/rebuildAll.sh).

- Make sure the tests keep running when content/PoiResponse.py is
  removed.  This file should not *really* be removed though as we need
  it still during migration.
