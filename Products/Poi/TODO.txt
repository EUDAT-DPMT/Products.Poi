Poi TODO

    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------

    o Possible fields to add:
        - Watchers (list of people to email upon issue activity)
        
    o May want some mechanism for confirming that issues have been fixed.
        - Can have some fancy workflow where original requester is able to
            confirm closed (may be annoying in some use cases to require this)
    
    o Other features to consider
        - Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
            fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
            always)
    
    o In-form transition for Issues in the same way issues are transitioned
        by responses (to make processing a "new" issue a one-step process)
    
    o More specific role than Manager for tracker managers
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    Security issues:
    
        o Enable giving and taking Manager localrole when changing tracker
            managers
        o Consider security settings more carefully
        o Test workflows/security properly
        o Create "new issue" worklist
    
    Performance:

        o Make tracker use BTreeFolder as base
        o Ensure templates work sensibly with large number of issues
    
    User interface:
        
        o Enable portal_factory for issues and responses
        o Saving a response should return to the parent issue
        o Put Issue and possibly Tracker in parentMetaTypesNotToQuery
    
        o Rethink UI templates - need to incorporate severity and topic
        o Add search interface    
    
    Incomplete:
    
        o Add email notifications
        
        o PloneSoftwareCenter integration
        
        o Make new icons
    
        o Write unit tests
            - at least one test per method
            - tests of PSC vocabs
            - tests of searches
            - tests of transitions
            - setup tests (workflow etc)?

        o Write a README :)
