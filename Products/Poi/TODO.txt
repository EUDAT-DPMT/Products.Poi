Poi TODO
--------

    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------

    o Possible fields to add:
        - Severity (e.g. critical, low - vocab field on base tracker; probably
            only editable by issue responders)
        - Watchers (list of people to email, at tracker level for all activity,
            and also at issue level, for activity on that issue)
        - Topic (is one level of "category" enough, or do we need both topic
            and category, e.g. User Interface / Suggested improvement)
        - Assignment (assign one or more users as responsible for an issue)
        - Issue and response attachments

        --> At tracker level, have list of responsible users. These users 
            optionally get an email when there is tracker activity. They 
            get a local role set so that they can edit issues, change issue
            severity etc. They can also be the target of issue assignments.
    
    o Other features to consider
        - Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
            fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
            always)
    
    o Alternative views (categorised by different fields)
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    o Add "rejected" state to issue workflow
    o Add state "new" to issue workflow, to signal it hasn't yet been
        categorised/approved. Responders should add a response which sets
        the state to "open" or "rejected" and re-categorise as appropriate.
    o Test workflows/security properly
    
    o Make tracker use BTreeFolder as base
    o Ensure templates work sensibly with large number of issues
    o Add search interface

    o Saving a response should return to the parent issue

    o Add email notifications

    o Finish PSC versions of templates
        - Should organise listings by release

    o Make new icons
    
    o Write unit tests
    
        - at least one test per method
        - tests of PSC vocabs
        - tests of searches
        - tests of transitions
        - setup tests (workflow etc)?

    o Write a README
