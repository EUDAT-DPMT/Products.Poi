Poi TODO
--------

    Items marked with ** are show-stoppers for beta release 

    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------
    
    o Link Areas and Plone groups. This way, all UI postings should fire
        a mail to the UI team, for example.
        - Can do this with column in availableAreas grid, but need better
            management of who can do this, or we'll get every project on
            plone.org sending emails to every random team. :)
        - Perhaps we therefore need to be a bit more discrimating with the
            manager role
    
    o In-form transition for Issues in the same way issues are transitioned
        by responses (to make processing a "new" issue a one-step process)

    o Possible fields to add to issues:
**      - Tagging of issues, so that managers can add a keyword tope, an issue
            and search for this. Allows more arbitrary organistion than
            topic/issue type, which is more for the user's benefit. For example,
            specific araes of the implementation could be used as tags.
        - Fixed-in version (should be able to set on response and affect issue)

    o Only install PoiPscTracker when PSC is detected (may be difficult with
        current ArchGenXML)

    o Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
        fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
        always; only if it can be done cleanly and with little/no performance
        overhead)
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    Bugs/Known issues:

        o Deleting a response will cause issue text to remain in issue
            SearchableText until a re-index (manage_beforeDelete?)

        o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe
        
        o Sending notification should happen in at_post_create_script(), not
            in _renameAfterCreation(), but an Archetypes bug prevents this
            since the hook is called after each save, not only the first one!

    Security issues:

        o Max-size validator on uploaded attachments

    User interface:

        o Turn off editable border in edit responses screen

        o Would be nice to link to releases when in PSC view

        o No way to specify sort order in issue search form, and no sensible
            way of sorting by severity

        o Want to have sortable tables, but they look funny without nosort if
            the title makes a row two lines long or more

        o May be confusing to track issue progress if users edit a response
            and change the issue state, e.g. using a response in the middle.
            Workflow history will still work, of course

        o Verify i18n tags and translations

    Incomplete:
    
**      o Finish writing unit tests
            - PSC integration
            - Tests for tracker states/permissions
            - Actual sending of notification emails (need dummy mail host)
            - Vocab + defaults methods
