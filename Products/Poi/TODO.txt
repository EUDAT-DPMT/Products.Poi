    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------
    
    o More sophisticated email notification, e.g. based on workflow transitions
    o Ability to mail a list instead of individual managers
    o Link Topics and Plone groups. This way, all UI postings should fire
        a mail to UI team, for example.
    
    o Max-size validator on uploaded attachments
    
    o In-form transition for Issues in the same way issues are transitioned
        by responses (to make processing a "new" issue a one-step process)
    
    o More specific role than Manager for tracker managers

    o Possible fields to add:
        - Watchers (list of people to email upon issue activity)

    o Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
        fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
        always)
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    Bugs:

        o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe

    Security issues:
    
        o Consider security settings more carefully
        o Test workflows/security properly
        o Create "new issue" worklist
    
    User interface:
        
        o Rethink UI templates - need to incorporate release, severity and topic
        o Ensure templates work sensibly with large number of issues
        o Add search interface    
    
    Incomplete:
        
        o PloneSoftwareCenter integration
        
        o Make new icons
    
        o Write unit tests
            - at least one test per method
            - tests of PSC vocabs
            - tests of searches
            - tests of transitions
            - setup tests (workflow etc)?

        o Write a README :)
