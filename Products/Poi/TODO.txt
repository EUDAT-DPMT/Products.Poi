Poi TODO
--------

    Items marked with ** are show-stoppers for beta release 

    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------
    
    o Link Topics and Plone groups. This way, all UI postings should fire
        a mail to the UI team, for example.
    
    o In-form transition for Issues in the same way issues are transitioned
        by responses (to make processing a "new" issue a one-step process)
    
    o Use a more specific role than Manager for tracker managers?

    o Possible fields to add:
        - Watchers (list of people to email upon issue activity)
        - Fixed-in version (should be able to set on response and affect issue)

    o Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
        fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
        always)
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    Bugs/Known issues:

**      o Automatic transition in response workflow never triggers, hence
            responses remain deletable and editable by owner

        o No way to specify sort order in issue search form, and no sensible
            way of sorting by severity

        o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe

    Security issues:

        o Max-size validator on uploaded attachments

    User interface:
                
        o Want to have sortable tables, but they look funny without nosort if
            the title makes the item two lines long or more.

        o May be confusing to track issue progress if users edit a response
            and change the issue state, e.g. using a response in the middle.
            Workflow history will still work, of course.

**      o Make new icons

        o Verify i18n tags and translations
        o Email notifications are not internationalised
        
        o Email notification is not very generalised, taking place in PoiIssue,
            PoiTracker and poi_issue_workflow_scripts

    Incomplete:
        
**      o PloneSoftwareCenter integration
            - Should use referenced releases insead of vocab-based ones
            - Consider linking issues/responses to improvement proposals
    
**      o Write unit tests
            - Setup tests (types, workflow etc.)
            - Custom methods
                - getFilteredIssues()
                - setManagers()
                - setNewIssueState() + getIssueStateBefore/After()
                - Notification mail logic
                - Issue SearchableText
            - Vocabulary methods

        o Write a README :)
