    Possible features for inclusion:
    --------------------------------
    
**  o More sophisticated email notification, e.g. based on workflow transitions
        - Should email original author upon 'resolve' at least
**  o Ability to mail a mailing list instead of individual managers
    o Link Topics and Plone groups. This way, all UI postings should fire
        a mail to the UI team, for example.
    
    o In-form transition for Issues in the same way issues are transitioned
        by responses (to make processing a "new" issue a one-step process)
    
    o More specific role than Manager for tracker managers

    o Possible fields to add:
        - Watchers (list of people to email upon issue activity)
        - Fixed-in version (should be able to set on response and affect issue)

    o Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
        fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
        always)
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    
    Bugs/Known issues:

**      o Non-owner/manager can change workflow states (need to set guard roles)
            - Only manager should be allowed to change the state, except
                change from resolved => closed.
        o Issue owner can delete responses
            - Only manager should be able to delete responses

        o No way to specify sort order in issue search form, and no sensible
            way of sorting by severity
        
        o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe
    
    Security issues:
    
        o Consider security settings more carefully
            - Currently, owner and manager have edit privileges on issues and
                responses. May wish to disallow owner of issue or response
                from editing after it has been saved?
        o Test workflows/security properly
        
        o Max-size validator on uploaded attachments
    
    User interface:
                
        o Want to have sortable tables, but they look funny without nosort if
            the title makes the item two lines long or more.
            
        o May be confusing to track issue progress if users edit a response
            and change the issue state, e.g. using a response in the middle.
            Workflow history will still work, of course.
        
        o Make new icons
    
    Incomplete:
        
        o PloneSoftwareCenter integration
            - Should use referenced releases insead of vocab-based ones
            - Consider linking issues/responses to improvement proposals
    
        o Write unit tests
            - Setup tests (types, workflow etc.)
            - Custom methods
                - getFilteredIssues()
                - setManagers()
                - setNewIssueState() + getIssueStateBefore/After()
                - Notification mail logic
                - Issue SearchableText
            - Vocabulary methods

        o Write a README :)
