Changelog for Poi
=================

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

Poi branch maurits-inline-response-adding
-----------------------------------------

- Add migration (GenericSetup upgrade step) from old to new style
  responses.
  [maurits]

- Use the text of new style responses too for the SearchableText of an
  issue.
  [maurits]

- No __parent__ and __name__ for PoiIssue anymore.  Instead pass the
  issue as descriptions argument when firing the ObjectModifiedEvent
  for a response.  Works fine and needs no migration.
  [maurits]

- Use __parent__ and __name__ for responses.
  [maurits]

- Add "self.__parent__ = self.__name__ = None" to __init__() of
  PoiIssue.  Needs migration.  Not sure if that is the best solution
  to the problem that in the event handler for modified responses the
  issue has no acquisition context.

- Fire ObjectRemovedEvent when deleting a response and
  ObjectModifiedEvent when modifying it.
  [maurits]

- When adding something to an issue check that it really is an
  IResponse.
  [maurits]

- Add buttons and browser views for deleting and editing responses.
  [maurits]

- Add PoiMessageFactory.
  [maurits]

- Add method delete(id) for deleting responses.
  [maurits]

- In response adapter rename total to highest.
  [maurits]

- When FCKeditor is installed and an anonymous visitor adds a
  response, make sure this works by using the default html text area
  then.  Same change as in the FCKeditor code itself in r59427.
  [maurits]

- When in config.py DEFAULT_ISSUE_MIME_TYPE is set to text/html, use a
  wysiwyg field in the add response form.  Tested with kupu.  Haul the
  responses through portal_transforms and through linkDetection.
  [maurits]

- Give responses a type additional/clarification/reply.
  [maurits]

- Add browser test for adding a tracker, issue and response.
  [maurits]

- Unit test the response browser views.
  [maurits]

- Use aq_inner.aq_parent to get the parent of an issue.
  [maurits]

- Add unit tests for browser.response.voc2dict.
  [maurits]

- Add unit tests for the adapters.
  [maurits]

- Show border around responses, like in the original layout.
  [maurits]

- Check that the changes within a response are allowed (new severity
  in available_severities, etc).
  [maurits]

- Make difference between available_transitions and
  transitions_for_display; also for the other response options.
  [maurits]

- Add methods sorted_keys/values/items for the ResponseContainer.
  Show the sorted items in the view (so 1, ..., 9, 10 instead of 1,
  10, ..., 9).
  [maurits]

- Store OOBTree and total in a PersistentMapping instead of only the
  OOBTree directly in the annotations.
  [maurits]

- Check radio buttons of response based on current status for all
  options.  Rename options to be in line with the fields of the parent
  Task.
  [maurits]

- Store creator and creation date of response.
  [maurits]

- Use an OOBtree instead of a PersistentMapping to store the
  responses.
  [maurits]

- Use zope.app.container.sample.SampleContainer as base class for
  ResponseContainer.  Store a PersistentMapping in it.  Show the
  sorted responses.
  [maurits]

- Start creating zope 3 style lightweight responses instead of big fat
  Archetypes objects.
  [maurits]

- Add provider:poi.response.add that gives you a form for adding a
  response when viewing an issue.
  [maurits]

- Add browser view @@create_response that creates a response in the
  current issue, based on the request form.
  [maurits]


Poi 1.2 - (Unreleased)
----------------------

- Use event handlers for keeping the SearchableText of an issue in
  sync with its responses.  This comes in place of the updateResponses
  method of an issue that was called by poi_response_update_issue.cpy.
  [maurits]

- Eggification: Poi/trunk has been moved to
  Products.Poi/trunk/Products/Poi
  [maurits]

- Modernization of trackers:

  o Add browser view @@issuefolder that handles the part of PoiTracker
    that involves being just a folder with issues.

  o Move getFilteredIssues, getIssueSearchQueryString and
    buildIssueSearchQuery from PoiTracker to browser view.

  o Remove skins/Poi/getOrphanedIssues.py and skins/Poi/getMyIssues.py.
    Put equivalents in the browser view.

  [maurits]

- Move getNumberFromString, linkBugs and linkSvn from
  content/PoiTracker.py into new utils.py as they need no context.
  [maurits]

- Memoize the getTagged* values for intelligenttext fields in PoiIssue
  and PoiResponse; clear them when setting those fields.  This speeds
  up viewing an issue or response.
  [maurits]

- Modernize code:
  - Cleanup imports with pyflakes.
  - use logging instead of zLOG.
  [maurits]

- Do not try to apply a CustomizationPolicy.
  [maurits]

- Remove backwards compatibility code for old CMFCore permissions.
  [maurits]

- Remove references to contentmigration, as this was only needed for
  migrations from 1.0 beta 2 to 1.0 rc 1.
  [maurits]

- Remove UML model as we do not use that anymore.
  [maurits]


Poi 1.1.1 - (Unreleased)
------------------------


    - Fix UnicodeEncodeError in RSS feed by not setting headers in the
      response.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/166
      [maurits]


    - Encode unicode names of email addresses using the site encoding.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/161
      [maurits]


Poi 1.1 final - Released December 27, 2007
------------------------------------------

    (No changes compared to rc4.)


Poi 1.1 rc 4 - Released December 22, 2007
-----------------------------------------

    - Fix "TypeError: can't pickle code objects" when updating the
      schema of PoiTrackers by using the new 'isDataGridFilled'
      validator.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/160
      [maurits]

    - Added more Norwegian translations.
      [Espen Moe-Nilssen]


Poi 1.1 rc 3 - Released December 14, 2007
---------------------------------------

    - Fix Inconsistent linking to other issues and changesets:
        Links in the steps field of an issue are now also detected.
      Allow more links to be detected:
      - issues: #1, issue:1, ticket:1, bug:1.
      - changesets/revisions: r1, changeset:1, [1].
      Add lots of tests for the link detection in a tracker.
      http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/159
      [Per Erik Strandberg, maurits]


Poi 1.1 rc 2 - Released December 5, 2007
--------------------------------------

    - Add our indexes to the catalog with some code in AppInstall.py.
      Doing it there instead of in profiles/default/catalog.xml like
      previously means we do not need to reindex those indexes after
      every reinstall.
      [maurits]


Poi 1.1 rc 1 - Released December 4, 2007
---------------------------------------

    - Use email_from name of portal in the emails.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/154
      [maurits]

    - Fixed error in deleting response to an issue.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/151
      [maurits]

    - Added partial Norwegian translation.
      [Espen Moe-Nilssen]

    - Fix i18n of email sending:
      - Improve sending of emails with non-ascii character sets (mostly
        accented characters).
      - Use portal property email_charset for email sending if available.
      - Mime encode the subject of emails.
      Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/146
      [maurits, Stefano Deponti]

    - Register our skin layer for all skins instead of just for Plone
      Default.
      [maurits]


Poi 1.1 beta 1 - Released Movember 19, 2007
-----------------------------------------

    - This release introduces Plone 3.0 compatibility while keeping
      compatibility with Plone 2.5.
      [Alexander Limi and Maurits van Rees]

    - Link detection.  Trackers now have an svnUrl field.  For
      example, if your product is hosted in the Plone collective you
      can set this field to
      ``http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/%(rev)s``.  Then you
      can type 'r42' in an issue/response (any intelligenttext field)
      and get a link to that changeset.
      [Daniel Nouri]

    - Advanced issue search form now has a way to search for issues
      that match *all* tags, not only any, which helps when you're
      working a lot with tags.
      [Daniel Nouri]

    - Added a log-view for Poi trackers. This view renders a report on
      the most recent additions to the tracker; as such it will be
      similar to what is sent out as e-mail notifications.
      [Malthe Borch]

    - Cleanup of translations.
      [Maurits van Rees]

    - Loads of small bug fixes.
      [Maurits van Rees and others]


Poi 1.0 - (never officially released)
-----------------------------------

    - initial version.
      [optilude, rocky, panjunyong, others]
